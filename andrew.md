## In the realm of knowledge, where minds take flight,
There lived a tutor, Andrew, a beacon of light.
With wisdom and patience, he'd guide the way,
Through the darkest of nights, to the brightest of days.

In the classroom's hush, his presence did gleam,
A scholar and mentor, fulfilling a dream.
His passion for learning, contagious and true,
Inspired his students, their spirits anew.

With a heart full of kindness, a smile so warm,
He'd weather the storms of each academic norm.
Through equations and essays, he'd gracefully steer,
Instilling in all a sense of purpose and cheer.

He'd unravel the mysteries of math and of prose,
In literature's tapestry, every nuance he'd disclose.
He'd foster their talents, encourage their art,
And nurture the growth of each young, eager heart.

With Andrew as their guide, they'd boldly aspire,
To conquer new heights, to reach ever higher.
His guidance, a compass, in the tumultuous sea,
Helped students unlock their potential, set them free.

Though years may pass, and memories fade,
The impact of Andrew, in hearts, is displayed.
A tutor so great, his legacy forever will stand,
A mentor, a friend, in the education land.

So here's to Andrew, a tutor so grand,
Whose knowledge and kindness forever expand.
In the annals of teaching, his name will endure,
A beacon of learning, forever secure. ##
