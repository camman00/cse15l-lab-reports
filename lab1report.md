#### For each of the commands cd, ls, and cat, and using the workspace you created in this lab:

##### 1) Share an example of using the command with no arguments.
##### 2) Share an exmaple of using the command with a path to a directory as an argument.
##### 3) Share an example of using the command with a path to a file as an argument.

#### So that’s 9 total examples (3 for each command). For each, include:

A screenshot or Markdown code block showing the command and its output
What the working directory was when the command was run
A sentence or two explaining why you got that output (e.g. what was in the filesystem, what it meant to have no arguments).
Indicate whether the output is an error or not, and if it’s an error, explain why it’s an error.

# cd with no args

* The working directory is the home directory.
* cd ran with no args will bring you back to the configured home directory.
* There is no error as this functionality is intentional.

# cd with a path to dir as arg
<img width="276" alt="image" src="https://github.com/camman00/cse15l-lab-reports/assets/20690269/c1dfd959-933f-45ae-9370-877d2ae30e5c">
* The inital working directory was the home directory.
* cd ran with file directory. Terminal is now based on that directory. Essentially we navigate from the previous directory to the new directory with the command
* No errors. This is what is supposed to happen.

# cd with a file as an arg
<img width="361" alt="image" src="https://github.com/camman00/cse15l-lab-reports/assets/20690269/331a2f82-bb77-49f6-8ea0-77fb64f75fc5">
* The current working directory is ~/lecture1
* cd ran with a direct path to file results in an error/warning in console. This is because the argument should be for a directory not a file.
* Error/warning occured. Needs a legitimate directory in order to work.

# ls with no args
<img width="380" alt="image" src="https://github.com/camman00/cse15l-lab-reports/assets/20690269/0971422e-4bd8-437e-b886-5a6d4c085f83">
* The current working directory is ~/lecture1
* ls with no arguments lists all the files in the current directory.
* No errors this is expected.

# ls with dir as arg
<img width="294" alt="image" src="https://github.com/camman00/cse15l-lab-reports/assets/20690269/536d93ce-9244-4bd3-ac08-3c5db32fe74a">
* The current working directory is ~/lecture1
* ls with a directory as argument displays that specific directories contents
* No errors here!

# ls with file path as arg
<img width="358" alt="image" src="https://github.com/camman00/cse15l-lab-reports/assets/20690269/a0edbf62-b9ab-4268-b3a7-8e54e4bd37d1">
* The current working directory is ~/lecture1
* ls with a file path as an arg just prints the file name itself
* This is not an error but something I did not expect.

# cat with no args
<img width="273" alt="image" src="https://github.com/camman00/cse15l-lab-reports/assets/20690269/d073ead6-2973-4425-ae9f-1a4ef93747c8">
* The current working directory is ~/lecture1
* cat with no args it seems like the console just stalls until you enter in something after the line break. Oddly enough the console will just repeat what you input: as shown below:
<img width="292" alt="image" src="https://github.com/camman00/cse15l-lab-reports/assets/20690269/6d5c0753-2446-4229-939c-8d3cfe316b25">
* No error were displayed to the console.

# cat with dir as arg
<img width="363" alt="image" src="https://github.com/camman00/cse15l-lab-reports/assets/20690269/ded041a4-b432-490c-8818-5f84653b8789">
* Working directory is ~/lecture1
* cat with a directory as an argument is similar to cd with a file path as argument.
* Console informs us that the the provided path is a directory.

# cat with file path as an arg
<img width="590" alt="image" src="https://github.com/camman00/cse15l-lab-reports/assets/20690269/4663b8e6-412f-4642-bb91-db32164ab55f">
* Working directory is ~/lecture1
* It displayed the internal text of the file - very cool
* no errors this is correct!
